# Censorc keyword definitions

#### $GENERAL SETTINGS:

| keyword: | definition: |
| :--- | :--- |
| nconf | how many conformers should be considered. Either a number or the flag 'all'. |
| charge | molecular charge of the molecule under investigation. |
| unpaired | number of unpaired electrons in the molecule under investigation. |
| solvent | Solvent if the molecule is in solution phase, else `gas`. |
| â€‹prog\_rrho | QM-code used for the calculation of thermostatistical contributions. This is only feasible with xtb, since normally a large number of hessian calculations have to be performed. |
| temperature | Temperature \(in Kelvin\) used for the Boltzmann evaluations. |
| trange | temperature range which is used to calculate free energies at different temperatures \(considered in G\_mRRHO and dG\_solv\[only COSMO-RS\]\). The temperature range will only be evaluated if multitemp is set to `on`. |
| multitemp | Evaluate free energies at different temperatures defined in trange. |
| evaluate\_rrho | Option to consider /not consider thermostatistical contributions. |
| consider\_sym | Option to consider symmetry in the thermostatistical contribution \(only xtb\) |
| bhess | Calculate single point hessians \(SPH\) on the geometry, instead of "ohess" \(optimization + hessian calculation\). |
| imagthr | threshold for inverting imaginary frequencies for thermostatistical contributions \(in cm-1\). Internal defaults are applied if set to 'automatic'. |
| sthr | rotor cut-off \(cm-1\) used for the thermostatical contributions. Internal defaults are applied if set to 'automatic'. |
| scale | scaling factor for frequencies in vibrational partition function. Internal defaults are applied if set to 'automatic'. |
| rmsdbias | gESC related, using rmsdpot.xyz to be consistent to CREST |
| sm\_rrho | solvent model applied in the GFNn-xTB thermostatistical contribution calculation. |
| check | Terminate the CENSO run if too many calculations crash. |
| prog | QM code used for part0, part1 and part2, this can be TURBOMOLE or ORCA. |
| func | functional used in part1 \(prescreening\) and part2 \(optimization\) |
| basis | basis set used in combination with func in part1 \(prescreening\) and part2 \(optimization\). If basis is set to 'automatic' the basis set is chosen internally. |
| maxthreads | Used for parallel calculation. Maxthreads determines the number of independent calculations running in parallel. E.g. resulting in 4 independent single-point /optimization calculations. |
| omp | Used for parallel calculation. Omp determines the number of cores each independent calculation can use. Eg. maxthreads = 4 and omp = 5 resulting in 4 independent calculations and each independent calculation uses 5 cores. |
| cosmorsparam | Flag for choosing COSMO-RS parameterizations. If set to 'automatic' the input from the COSMO-RS input line is chosen. |

#### $PART0 - CHEAP-PRESCREENING - SETTINGS:

| keyword: | definition: |
| :--- | :--- |
| part0 | Option to turn the "cheap prescreening part" on or off.  |
| func0 | Functional used in part0. |
| basis0 | Basis set used in combination with func0. If basis0 is set to 'automatic' the basis set is chosen internally. |
| part0\_gfnv | GFN version employed in the thermostatistical contribution in part0.  |
| part0\_threshold | Threshold/Energy-window \(kcal/mol\) within which all conformers are considered. |

#### $PART1 - PRESCREENING - SETTINGS:
